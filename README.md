# SkyExtractCookie for Android

SkyExtractCookie is a complementary program for the [plugin.video.skyott addon](https://github.com/Paco8/plugin.video.skyott). With this application, you can generate a *.key file that enables you to log in to the streaming service through the plugin.video.skyott addon.

When you launch the application, it will open the login page where you can enter your credentials. Once you do that, the application will retrieve an access token and save it as a *.key file in the `Download` folder of your device. After that, you can use the option `login with a key file` and select this key file to log in.

## Notes
- This application is currently under development. There may be bugs, and it might not function correctly. I'm not an Android developer, I just looked for some sample code and somehow I managed to put together something that seems to work.
- The application will not appear in the launcher on Android TV. However, you can locate it by navigating to Settings, Applications.
