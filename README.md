# SkyExtractCookie for Android

SkyExtractCookie is a complementary program for the [plugin.video.skyott addon](https://github.com/Paco8/plugin.video.skyott). With this application, you can generate a *.key file that enables you to log in to the streaming service through the plugin.video.skyott addon.

When you launch the application, it will open the login page where you can enter your credentials. Once you do that, the application will retrieve an access token and save it as a *.key file in the `Download` folder of your device. After that, you can use the option `login with a key file` and select this key file to log in.
